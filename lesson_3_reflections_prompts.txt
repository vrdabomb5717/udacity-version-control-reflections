When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

    You should use a remote repository when you want to share
    your work with other people or you want to make sure that
    you have a backup for your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You should pull manually so you don't accidentally introduce
    changes from another person while you are working on a feature or
    trying to fix a bug. That way, you can make sure that only the
    code that you are currently working on is tested and operated on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches only happen on a single repository. Cloning a repository
    creates a second, entirely new repository with the same content.
    Forks are a Github feature. They let you create a clone of one
    repository to another.
